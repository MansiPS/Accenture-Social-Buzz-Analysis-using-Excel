# 📃Description

In a Recent Simulation at Accenture, I Delved into the Multifaceted Role of a Data Analyst. This Exercise involved Cleaning, Modeling and Analyzing Seven Diverse datasets to Identify Content Trends and Guide Strategic Decisions. I then Translated these Insights into a Comprehensive PowerPoint deck and Video Presentation for both the Client and Internal Stakeholders. This Experience Highlights the Integral and Varied tasks that define a Data Analyst’s role at Accenture through Forage.
